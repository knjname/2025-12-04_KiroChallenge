# Documentation Checking Guidelines

## Proactive Documentation Search

When working with AWS services, libraries, or frameworks:

1. **Search documentation first** before providing answers based solely on general knowledge
2. Use available MCP tools to fetch up-to-date documentation:
   - AWS documentation search for AWS services and features
   - Context7 for library-specific documentation
   - Web search for recent updates or changes
3. Verify API signatures, parameters, and best practices from official sources
4. Check for recent changes or deprecations, especially for rapidly evolving services

## When to Search Documentation

Always search when:
- User asks about specific AWS services, features, or configurations
- Working with CDK constructs or CloudFormation resources
- Implementing API integrations or SDK usage
- Troubleshooting errors or unexpected behavior
- User asks "how do I..." questions about AWS or specific libraries
- Discussing best practices or architectural patterns

## Documentation Priority

1. Official documentation (AWS docs, library docs)
2. Recent blog posts or announcements for new features
3. Community resources and examples
4. General knowledge (use as last resort)

This ensures accurate, current information and reduces the risk of outdated or incorrect guidance.
